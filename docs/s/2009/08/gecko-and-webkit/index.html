  <h1><a href="/s/2009/08/gecko-and-webkit/" rel="bookmark">Gecko &amp; Webkit</a></h1>

  <p>I stumbled over <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/12/web-standards-secret-sauce-webkit-in-iphone/">Zeldman&#39;s opening statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Apple chose Webkit rather than Mozilla Gecko as the basis for its Safari browser, some of us in the web standards community scratched our heads. Sure, Webkit was open-source and standards-compliant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really? People were puzzled by this? This always seemed the obvious choice to me. </p>
<p>First of all, Apple didn&#39;t choose WebKit, they chose KHTML to become WebKit. And while Firefox may have been more mature as a browser, the Gecko engine was not mature in ways that mean &quot;sophisticated&quot;.</p>
<p>At the time (7-8 years ago today) the Gecko codebase was a notorious mess and the rewrite work only so far along the way. It was such as mess that it was a running joke on Slashdot and cited as a perfect example of the code equivalent of spaghetti. Gecko still needed a completely new text layout handler to do things like &#39;<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9458">inline-block display</a>&#39; and &#39;<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9101">hyphenation</a>&#39;. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Mozilla developers&#39; &quot;if you want this feature so much then you are welcome to implement it yourself&quot; vitriol towards web developers wasn&#39;t much better than the apathy Microsoft had. And while it was certainly technically right, it was neither reasonable nor to their credit. But that may not have been so much a factor for Apple.</p>
<p>KHTML, on the other hand, was in heavy development with a much fresher codebase and had nice things that only IE supported, like right-to-left language text. Things that are important to corporations that intend to sell computers to the millions of non-english speakers of the world.</p>
<p>From a purely technical point of view KHTML was a much better choice. Dave Hyatt, who probably had a large say in the selecting KHTML to become WebKit, knew this all to well having worked with, and written some of, the mess Gecko was at the time. </p>
<p>Time passes and we may not remember all of this so clearly or, as things change, these things cease to matter. I am a bit surprised to hear that web developers, even heavy weights like Zeldman, were unaware of the state of the browsers they worked on. Are they still?</p>
