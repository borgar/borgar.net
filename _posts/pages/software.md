## JavaScript libraries

Miscellaneous JavaScript libraries.

* **[Numfmt](https://github.com/borgar/numfmt)**  
    Full ECMA-376 number and date formatting in JavaScript. It can handle everything 
    Microsoft Excel produces, and a bit more.

* **[_fx_](https://github.com/borgar/fx)**  
    A tokenizer, parser, and other utilities to work with Excel formula code. 
    It is originally intended for syntax highlighting Excel code, but it now includes
    a full parser for Excel expressions as well as other niceties.

* **[Textbox](https://github.com/borgar/textbox)**  
    Textbox is a simple library to layout multiline text for display on SVG or Canvas.
    It can fairly decently line-break and render rich text given some boundaries.
    It understands a subset of HTML and LaTeX syntaxes. 

* **[Textile.js](https://github.com/borgar/textile-js)**  
    The best and fastest implementation of a Textile parser in JavaScript.
    Uses a common interface with the most popular Markdown library so
    it's developer friendly too.

* **[xlsx-convert](https://github.com/borgar/xlsx-convert)**  
    This is a Node.js utility to convert Excel XLSX files to JSON format.
    It supports only XLSX files and outputs a flavor of CSF.

* **[Dateutil](https://github.com/borgar/dateutil)**  
    A collection date utility methods for JavaScript.
    Compatible with Node.js or browsers. Available through [npm](http://search.npmjs.org/#/dateutil).

* **[String.format](https://github.com/borgar/String.format)**  
    A full implementation of Python string formatting in JavaScript.

* **[Gannet](https://github.com/borgar/gannet)**  
    The static site (blog) generator that builds this website. It is similar 
    to Jekyl or Pelican, written in JS, but is mostly only useful to one person: me.
