## JavaScript libraries

Miscellaneous JavaScript libraries.

* **[Textbox](https://github.com/borgar/textbox)**

    Textbox is a simple library to layout multiline text for display on SVG or Canvas. It can fairly decently line-break and render rich text given some boundaries. It understands a subset of HTML and LaTeX syntaxes. 

* **[Textile.js](https://github.com/borgar/textile-js)**

    The best and fastest implementation of a Textile parser in JavaScript. Uses a common interface with the most popular Markdown library so it's developer friendly too.

* **[Dateutil](https://github.com/borgar/dateutil)**  

    A collection date utility methods for JavaScript.
    Compatible with Node.js or browsers. Available through [npm](http://search.npmjs.org/#/dateutil).

* **[String.format](https://github.com/borgar/String.format)**

    A full implementation of Python string formatting in JavaScript.

* **[Gannet](https://github.com/borgar/gannet)**  

    The static site (blog) generator that builds this website. It is similar 
    to Jekyl or Pelican, written in JS, but is mosly only useful to one person: me.

* **[Hugs](https://github.com/borgar/hugs)**  

    A small JavaScript templating system. That loves you.
