Borgar Þorsteinsson was born on the 16th of october 1975 and raised in the west-side of Reykjavík – mostly on [Skyr][skyr] and [arcade games][games]. He still resides in the capital of Iceland and fights for better code in the universe when he's not single dad'ing it up every other week. He doesn’t smoke, or drink to excess, nor eats any of his friends, the animals.

Borgar is employed by [GRID][work] as a data visualization and JavaScript programmer, and all around web guy.
