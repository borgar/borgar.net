Every now and then I get contacted by people interested in my Sokoban clones, or some aspect of them. Often it is [the levels][mysoko] and/or how to parse them, but often it is the graphics.

Since [Sokoban][sk] is a popular game to program, I figured I could help aspiring game authors out by providing free graphics. So, I've published all Sokoban game skins created by me with a liberal [Creative Commons license][cc] on GitHub.

Have fun: [github.com/borgar/sokoban-skins][gh]
