My submission to the programming competition [Þú átt orðið][1] was the computer game [Orðavinda][2] (loosely translated: "Wordwinder"). The basic premise of the competition was to create something interesting upon a newly opened declension database of modern Icelandic language.

The game is based on an older idea and of course [a long history of word games][3]. To my pleasant surprise I won the first prize, and judgeing by response, have managed to halt all office work in Iceland.

The game is completely made in HTML and JavaScript but uses Flash if available to play sounds. Anyone curious about the internals should examine the [game's GitHub repository][4]. The game is free software under ther terms of the [GPL software license][5].
