At 3:38 in the morning on the 28th of this month, I had the pleasure of being present to witness the birth of my daughter. She weighed in at 14 marks - or 3550 grams[^1] - and has a slightly darker hair color (so far) than her parents.

[Her mother][5] and I have since then been taking it easy, as far as that goes under the circumstances, and trying to get to know the new member of the family. So far everything is going well and we seem to be getting into swing of things. On the whole, it's been an enjoyable experience so far.

[^1]: For some strange reason babies are the only thing in Iceland not measured with the metric system, but rather an archaic gold measure.
