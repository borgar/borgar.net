What you are looking at is a javascript remake of a demoscreen from the world famous [Union Demo][1] (1989). The screen was originally designed and programed by the *TNT-Crew*. It firmly remains one of my all time favorite screens from my all time favorite *demo*.

I built it yesterday as a test. The *Starballs* screen was an easy pick, it was possible to reach some similarity to it with javascript, and I allready had it done as a java applet. Far from being any groundbreaking stuff, what I am doing is simply testing how different browsers cope with some javascript things.

My favorite browser for viewing this is [Opera][2]. My favorite browser Firefox doesn't handle it so well.

Still, it's a nice piece of geek nostalgia.
